'''
This code uses the pickle library to deserialize a piece of data. 
However, the pickle library can be dangerous to use for deserialization 
because it is vulnerable to attack through maliciously crafted data. 
An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code 
on the system, leading to serious security risks.

Dependabot might detect this vulnerability and suggest using a 
safer alternative for deserialization, such as the json or yaml libraries.

It's important to carefully consider the security implications of the 
libraries and tools you use in your code, and to regularly check for and 
address vulnerabilities to ensure the security of your application. 
ependabot can help automate this process by regularly checking your 
dependencies for known vulnerabilities and suggesting updates to fix them.
