Verse 1:
I thought we had something special
But she said she needed to be mettle
I tried to fight for her love
But she said I just wasn't enough

She packed her bags and walked out the door
Leaving me alone on the floor
My heart is shattered, my world's in pieces
I can't believe she left me for Jesus

Chorus:
Getting dumped by your girlfriend
Feels like a kick in the stomach
You're left with nothing but pain
And the memories of what could've been

Verse 2:
I don't know how I'll carry on
Without her love, I feel so gone
I'll try to pick up the pieces
And find a way to mend these leases

But for now, I'll just sit and wallow
In this heartache that I can't swallow
I'll try to find a way to move on
But right now, my heart feels gone

Chorus:
Getting dumped by your girlfriend
Feels like a kick in the stomach
You're left with nothing but pain
And the memories of what could've been

Bridge:
She said she needed to find herself
But she left me on the shelf
I tried to hold on tight
But she slipped through my fingers like a kite

Now I'm left with nothing but regret
And a love that I'll never forget
I'll try to find a way to move on
But for now, I'll just sing this song

Chorus:
Getting dumped by your girlfriend
Feels like a kick in the stomach
You're left with nothing but pain
And the memories of what could've been
