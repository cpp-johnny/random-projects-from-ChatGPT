Verse 1:
I'm the mushroom king, ruling over my domain
I may be small, but I pack a mighty punch
I bring flavor to your dishes, and nutrition to your lunch
I'm a fungi, but don't get it twisted
I'm not just something you trip on, I'm something you'll have to deal with

Chorus:
Mushrooms, mushrooms, oh so divine
I'm here to remind you, I'm not just a side dish kind
I'm a power food, with benefits you can't deny
Mushrooms, mushrooms, give me a try

Verse 2:
I come in all shapes and sizes, colors and hues
I can grow on the ground, or up high in the dew
I'm a superfood, with antioxidants that are true
I can boost your immune system, and help you feel brand new

Chorus:
Mushrooms, mushrooms, oh so divine
I'm here to remind you, I'm not just a side dish kind
I'm a power food, with benefits you can't deny
Mushrooms, mushrooms, give me a try

Bridge:
Don't be afraid to try something new
I'm here to add flavor, and bring a little spice too
I'm not just a pizza topping, I'm more than that
I'm a tasty treat, that you should definitely add to your plate

Chorus:
Mushrooms, mushrooms, oh so divine
I'm here to remind you, I'm not just a side dish kind
I'm a power food, with benefits you can't deny
Mushrooms, mushrooms, give me a try
