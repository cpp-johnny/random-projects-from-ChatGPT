Verse 1:
I'm bringing rhymes straight from the past
To a world that's moving fast
Where the currency's digital
And the dictator's in the capital

Stalin's back and he's got a plan
To dominate with bitcoin in hand
He's taking over the market
And he won't stop until he's the target

Chorus:
Stalin uses bitcoin
He's got the power to win it
He's rising to the top
He's never gonna stop

Verse 2:
People thought he was gone for good
But he's back and he's understood
The power of the blockchain
And he's not afraid to take a stand

He's got the strength and the might
To bring down the ones who fight
Against his rise to the top
He's never gonna stop

Chorus:
Stalin uses bitcoin
He's got the power to win it
He's rising to the top
He's never gonna stop

Bridge:
He's got an army of bots
And a network of nodes
He's taking control of the world
And he's not slowing down

So beware of the man
Who's back with a plan
To rule with bitcoin in hand
He's never gonna stop

Chorus:
Stalin uses bitcoin
He's got the power to win it
He's rising to the top
He's never gonna stop
