# Random Projects from ChatGPT


## What is this? 
- this is a collection of random projects provided by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) by OpenAI
- this was created as an attempt to try out what ChatGPT has to offer and also have fun
- i'll be using ChatGPT to create some random stuff and [test its boundaries](https://github.com/cpp-johnny/random-projects-from-ChatGPT/blob/main/story-telling/Lenin%20Mushroom%20%F0%9F%8D%84)
- i'll also take this opportunity to [mess around with other programming language](https://github.com/cpp-johnny/random-projects-from-ChatGPT/search?l=Brainfuck)


## How do I use this/create similar results?
- you can type the prompt into [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), example: create a hangman game in C++
- however, you may  not get the same results as responses by ChatGPT are unique
