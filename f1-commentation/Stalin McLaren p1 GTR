"Welcome back to the track, where we're seeing some unexpected twists and turns in today's race. And it looks like we've just had a major incident involving Stalin in his McLaren P1 GTR.

It looks like Stalin was pushing his car to the limit, trying to make up ground on the leaders. But it looks like he may have gotten a little too aggressive, as he's just gone off the track and over the wall.

It's hard to say exactly what happened, but it looks like Stalin may have gotten a little too much wheelspin coming out of that turn. And with the wet conditions, it looks like he lost control of the car and went over the wall.

We'll have to wait for the replays to get a better look at what happened. But in the meantime, let's hope Stalin is okay and that he can walk away from this incident. This is just a reminder of how dangerous and unpredictable racing can be, even at the highest levels.

We'll keep you updated as we learn more about this incident. But for now, let's hope for the best and move on to the rest of the race."
